# CW Practice Unit (Self-Contained)
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a self-contained unit that can translate Morse code to English. I want to ensure that this build is as cheap as possible to reduce the barrier to entry. Morse code phone apps are effective tools for learning, but I disliked their compatibility with keys currently on the market. This CW practice unit is primarily designed to be used with an iambic paddle but could easily be adapted for any type of paddle.

### Task List
Hardware:

* Hardware schematic

* PCB design

Enclosure:

* Design a case

* Print the case

Software:

* Implement the iambic paddle

Documentation:

* Create a simple troubleshooting guide

* Link to the paddle design

* List of materials with links
